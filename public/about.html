      <h1 style="color: #328cdd">About Us</h1>
      <p style="color: #eeeeee">
        <strong>TeenHelper</strong> connects motivated teens with local
        opportunities. From coaching and tutoring to odd jobs and pet care. Our
        mission is simple: help teens earn, grow, and give back to their
        communities.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #eeeeee">
        It all started with a personal experience. When Sam Skuratovsky and his
        friends were looking for summer work training kids in sports, they
        realized they weren’t alone. Plenty of teens were eager to earn money
        and gain experience. What they needed was a way to connect with people
        in their neighborhoods.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #eeeeee">That’s how TeenHelper was born.</p>

          <h3>Sam Skuratovsky</h3>
          <p><strong>Founder, TeenHelper</strong></p>
          <p>
            Sam is a student at Greenwich High School and a proud member of the
            school's basketball team. In between classes and practice, Sam
            spends his time learning computer programming, something he’s been
            exploring with his dad since middle school.
          </p>
          <p>
            He founded TeenHelper to solve a problem he and his friends were
            facing — finding flexible, local work as teenagers. Today, he’s
            driven to help others do the same.
